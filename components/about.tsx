        After earning my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, I
        uncovered a deep passion for computer science and technology. The thrill
        of solving real-world problems and bringing ideas to life through coding
        has captivated me ever since. Now Iâ€™m studying IT in UNSW as a graduate
        student to expand my boundaries in this ever-evolving field.
